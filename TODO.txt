# DOCUMENTATION

 7a. Damage                                                             [007a0]


Ever wonder how damage works? Well, wonder no more... kind of.

There is a way to roughly approximate how much damage you're going to do to an
enemy. Use the following formula:

DMG = 5 x sqrt(ST/EN x ATK) x MOD x HITS X RND

DMG = Damage
ST  = Character's Strength stat
EN  = Enemy's Endurance stat
ATK = Atk value of equipped weapon OR Pwr value of used skill
MOD = Modifier based on the difference between character level and enemy level
HITS= Number of hits (for physical skills)
RND = Randomness factor (according to DragoonKain33, may be roughly between
      0.95 and 1.05)


From what I've seen, MOD tops out at around 1.6, and I'm sure that there's a
minimum as well. Yes, this means that damage scales similar to how experience
scales.

By the way, if an enemy is Downed, your attack will do ~+30% damage. If you
inflict a critical hit, your attack will do ~+60% damage. If the enemy is
Downed AND you inflict a critical hit, the modifiers stack and you will be
doing double damage.

Now, I can't claim to know how exactly the numbers work when an enemy attacks
you. I haven't been able to fit armor into the equation just yet. But this, I
think, is more important because we can estimate how much damage we do with
various weapons and skills, as well as compare amongst weapons and skills.

Update: I've been informed by Look Over There that armor defense serves only to
reduce physical damage and not magic damage. Makes sense to me.
